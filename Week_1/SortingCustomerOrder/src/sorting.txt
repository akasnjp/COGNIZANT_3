Understand Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Quick Sort
Quick Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2)
Merge Sort
Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n log n)


Analysis
Compare the Performance (Time Complexity) of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort
Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) - when the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the array is sorted in reverse order.
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n)
Average Case: O(n log n)
Worst Case: O(n^2) - when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot (this can be mitigated by choosing a good pivot).
Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred Over Bubble Sort
Efficiency: Quick Sort is more efficient on large datasets due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n). Bubble Sort, with its O(n^2) average-case time complexity, is significantly slower for large datasets.
Divide and Conquer: Quick Sort uses the divide-and-conquer approach, which makes it more efficient and scalable. Bubble Sort simply compares and swaps adjacent elements, which is less efficient.
Real-world Performance: In practice, Quick Sort outperforms Bubble Sort due to its better handling of large arrays and fewer overall comparisons and swaps.
