Concept of Recursion
Definition: Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The key idea is to break down a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, solve those, and combine their results.

Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops. This prevents infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow.

Recursive Case: The part of the algorithm where the method calls itself with a simpler or smaller input.

Advantages:

Simplifies code for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems, like tree traversal or solving mathematical sequences.
Often makes the code more elegant and easier to understand.
Disadvantages:

Recursive algorithms can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of multiple function calls.
May lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too deep


Implementation
The calculateFutureValue method computes the future value of an investment with a given principal, annual growth rate, and number of years. It uses recursion to apply the growth rate to the principal for each year until it reaches the base case (years == 0).

Base Case: When years is 0, return the principal as the future value.
Recursive Case: Calculate the future value by applying the growth rate and reducing the number of years by 1.



ANALYSIS
Time Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where

n is the number of years. This is because each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1 and performs a constant amount of work.

Space Complexity: O(n) due to the call stack for each recursive call.

Optimizing Recursive Solution
Memoization: Store results of previous calculations to avoid redundant computations. This technique is often used in dynamic programming but requires more space.

Tail Recursion: If possible, use tail recursion (where the recursive call is the last operation in the function). This can be optimized by the compiler to avoid additional stack frames.

Iterative Approach: Sometimes converting a recursive algorithm to an iterative one can be more efficient, especially for problems with deep recursion.
