Linear Search
Definition: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element of a list one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends.
Time Complexity: O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.
Best Case: O(1) - The element is found at the first position.
Worst Case: O(n) - The element is found at the last position or not found at all.
Advantages: Simple to implement and does not require the data to be sorted.
Disadvantages: Inefficient for large lists compared to binary search.
Binary Search
Definition: A search algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted list in half to locate a desired element.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the list.
Best Case: O(1) - The element is found at the middle of the list.
Worst Case: O(log n) - The list is divided until the element is found or the sublist is empty.
Advantages: Much faster than linear search for large lists if the data is sorted.
Disadvantages: Requires the list to be sorted and more complex to implement.


Analysis
Time Complexity
Linear Search: O(n) for both best and worst cases.
Binary Search: O(log n) for both best and worst cases (assuming the list is sorted).
When to Use Each Algorithm
Linear Search:

Use when the list is unsorted or small.
Suitable for cases where simplicity is more important than speed.
Binary Search:

Use when the list is large and sorted.
Preferred for faster search operations in large datasets.
