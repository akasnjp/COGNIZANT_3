Why Data Structures and Algorithms are Essential in Handling Large Inventories
Efficiency: Efficient data structures and algorithms ensure that operations like adding, updating, and deleting products can be performed quickly, even with large datasets.
Scalability: Choosing the right data structure can help manage the growth of the inventory without a significant performance drop.
Maintenance: A well-organized inventory system is easier to maintain, debug, and extend with new features.
Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem
ArrayList:

Pros: Simple to implement, allows random access.
Cons: Inefficient for searching and deleting elements, as these operations may require shifting elements.
HashMap:

Pros: Provides average constant-time complexity for add, update, and delete operations.
Cons: Requires more memory, does not maintain the order of elements.



ANALYSIS
Time Complexity of Each Operation in HashMap
Add Product:

Average Time Complexity: O(1)
Inserting a key-value pair in a HashMap is an average constant-time operation.
Update Product:

Average Time Complexity: O(1)
Updating a value associated with a key is also an average constant-time operation.
Delete Product:

Average Time Complexity: O(1)
Removing a key-value pair from a HashMap is an average constant-time operation.
Optimization Considerations
Handling Collisions: Ensure a good hash function to minimize collisions in the HashMap.
Load Factor Management: Adjust the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap to balance memory usage and performance.
Memory Usage: Monitor and manage memory usage, especially if the inventory grows significantly.
